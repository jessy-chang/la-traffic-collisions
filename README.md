# Los Angeles City Traffic Collisions
The objective of this project is to find the relationship between traffic collisions in Los Angeles City and the victimsâ€™ age, sex, and ethnicity, as well as the geographic location and time of these traffic collisions. Traffic has always been an issue for most people traveling around Los Angeles because it can take significant amount of time to get from place to place especially during rush hours. One of the reasons that causes major traffic delay is traffic collisions. Therefore, this specific dataset from Kaggle was used to understand if there are any associations between these traffic collisions and the age, sex and ethnicity of victims. Moreover, different neighborhoods in the Los Angeles City were looked into closely to understand which areas appear to be having the most traffic collisions.

## Datasets & Variables
The main dataset, Los Angeles Traffic Collision Data, used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/cityofLA/los-angeles-traffic-collision-data), which is originated from the Los Angeles Open Data. The raw dataset contains 467,481 records and 24 columns, with date range from January 2010 to April 2019. However, as I am only interested in events happened in the recent years, the dataset is filtered to include data from 2017 and onwards. Data fields not require for the analysis were also eliminated. After data cleaning and transformation process, the final data resulted in 107,844 records and 9 columns. A brief variable dictionary is shown in the below table:

| Variable      | Description   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Date Occurred | Date when the traffic collision occurred|
