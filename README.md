# Los Angeles City Traffic Collisions
The objective of this project is to find the relationship between traffic collisions in Los Angeles City and the victimsâ€™ age, sex, and ethnicity, as well as the geographic location and time of these traffic collisions. Traffic has always been an issue for most people traveling around Los Angeles because it can take significant amount of time to get from place to place especially during rush hours. One of the reasons that causes major traffic delay is traffic collisions. Therefore, this specific dataset from Kaggle was used to understand if there are any associations between these traffic collisions and the age, sex and ethnicity of victims. Moreover, different neighborhoods in the Los Angeles City were looked into closely to understand which areas appear to be having the most traffic collisions.
